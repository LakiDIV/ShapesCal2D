Console application to calculate area and perimeter of shapes

### How it's works
- User need to input the count of sides and the program will understand what shape it is
- According to the selected shape, the user fills up the inputs
- User get the answer 🤩
- Both area and perimeter 🤩🤩

### Why so simple 💔
My first Java application and just trying to understand how java works 😎
